# Endless Space -- Incremental Game
### v1.0
Endless space is a web-based incremental game created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The goal of this game is to simply increase your gold gerneration (gold per second, or gps) by as much as possible. This game is very similar to other popular incremental games such as "Cookie Clicker".

## Features - v1.0
- 12 Unique Upgrades to increase your gps.
- 12 Efficiency Upgrades which will add a multiplier to an upgrades current gps.
- Progress is saved when closing the browser, but you do not gain gold unless you have the tab open!
- A realtiem update tracker of the player's current gold and gps.
- A clicker multiplier upgrade, which allows the player to recieve more gold per manual click on the rocket.
- A reset progress button to start from scratch.

## Developer Notes
This game is still a work an progress. I plan to add more upgrades, achievements, other planets, prestige mode, rocket building, and much more!
